# BreWish-API
This API is written using the Django REST Framework: http://www.django-rest-framework.org

If you need to explore the API, navigate to the root API url in a browser and include the format parameter using 
'html' for the value:
<root API URL>?format=html

Default format (if you exclude the format parameter) is XML. When developing to the API, it is recommended to always include the preferred format in case the default is changed.
